Our initial SSH clone did not work because the homework is the public. We did not include the https repository link before selecting clone,the system redirected us to include the link which did work as expected.We also had challenges creating the branch because we did not cd into the HomeWork folder on gitbash
Group0 test. We had a challenge adding the code because we missed the "code ." step, so it didn't take us to the VS Code platform. Thereafter fixing this step, the "git add ." worked as well as the other following steps - git commit, git push. We then did a pull request and merged to the master.
